It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and governs the motion of celestial bodies and objects on Earth.

They are usually prepared by heating relatively low molecular mass, semi-fluid polymers, which become infusible and form an insoluble hard mass on heating due to cross-linking between polymer chains. Examples include Urea-Formaldehyde and Melamine-Formaldehyde resins.",
